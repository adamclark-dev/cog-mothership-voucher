# Changelog

## 2.2.0

- Refactored `Loader` to only run one query when loading vouchers
- Added second `$returnAsArray` parameter to `Loader::getByID()` to ensure that vouchers are always returned as an array if set to true. Defaults to false,
- Added private `_setQueryBuilder()` method to `Loader` for instanciating query builder with query set up to load vouchers
- Switched `Loader::_load()` method to private, as it was erroneously declared as public. **NOTE:** This is not considered a BC break as this was a bug, however, if you relied on this method your application will break. Use `Loader::getByID()` instead.
